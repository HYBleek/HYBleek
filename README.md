## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, welcome to my GitHub Profile!

I'm **Haoyang 'Henry' Cui**, currently a Master's student at **Dartmouth College**, with a background in **Computer Science and Mathematics** from the **University of Toronto**.

### ðŸ”¬ Research & Work
I'm actively involved in two labs at Dartmouth:
- [**The Bhattacharya Lab**](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/bhattacharya-lab/) â€“ Focused on **Image and Multimodal Data Analytics** for medicine.
- [**Lee Lab**](https://lee-lab.engineering.dartmouth.edu/) â€“ Dedicated to developing **proteomic analysis methods** to understand the protective mechanisms of antibodies with clinical relevance.

### ðŸš€ Current Projects
I'm currently working on three exciting projects:
- **Medical Image Segmentation Tool**  
  Developing a deep learning pipeline for segmenting cancer regions from **CT and PET data**.
- **Web-Based Immunology Pipeline**  
  Building a web server to bridge **wet lab experiments** and **dry lab data analysis** for **bioengineering of immunology**.
- **TinyML for Embedded Devices**  
  Creating ultra-lightweight ML models (under **256KB**) capable of running on low-resource hardware.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals
My long-term goal is to leverage machine learningâ€”especially **dimension reduction on RNA/DNA-seq data** and advanced models like **Diffusion** and **Autoregressive (AR) models**â€”to build smarter, **personalized digital health systems**.

I'm also currently trying to apply to **PhD programs** to further pursue this path.

### ðŸ’ª Fun Fact
I'm a passionate gym-goer! Iâ€™ve lost over **65 lbs (about 30 kg)** since finishing my undergrad. I'm even planning to write a book about my workout routines and nutrition strategies for sustainable weight control.
