<h1 align="center">👋 Hi, I'm Haoyang (Henry) Cui</h1>

🎓 MS in Health Data Science @ Dartmouth (Geisel School of Medicine)  
🎓 BSc in Computer Science & Mathematics @ University of Toronto  
💡 Building systems at the intersection of **biomedical research, full-stack engineering, and AI**

---

## 🔬 Research & Lab Work

I'm currently part of the [**Lee Lab**](https://lee-lab.engineering.dartmouth.edu/), where we explore:
- The **evolution of antibody repertoires** through high-throughput RNA/protein data
- Scalable modeling and automated analysis pipelines for **immunological data**

---

## 🚀 Current Projects

### 🧪 Web-Based Immunology Pipeline
> Building a full-stack platform to connect **wet lab experiments** with **HPC-powered dry lab analysis**, enabling automated submission, biological sequence search (FASTQ/FASTA), and real-time monitoring.

---

## 🎯 Long-Term Vision

I aim to build intelligent **digital health systems** powered by:
- **Dimension reduction** on RNA/DNA-seq & high-dimensional omics data
- **Autoregressive** and **Diffusion models** for medical prediction and generation

> Big update: My goals might evolve thanks to **AlphaGenome** — I'm honestly so excited I couldn't sleep when it dropped!

---

## 🛠️ Currently Learning
- **SAS** – for health data analytics & clinical applications  
- **CUDA** – to accelerate model training for medical imaging  
- **Agent-based AI** – for automating workflows in LLM pipelines  

---

## 🧬 Next Steps

I'm actively looking for:

- 🔬 **Research Assistantships** in computational biology (US or Canada)
- 🏥 **Full-Stack Systems Engineering roles** in the Bio/Health/MedTech domain

📬 If you’re hiring, collaborating, or just curious, feel free to reach out:  
**📧 haoyang.cui.hse@dartmouth.edu**

---

## 💪 Fun Fact

Outside the lab, I'm a dedicated gym-goer and health hacker. I’ve lost over **70 lbs (~32 kg)** since undergrad — and I'm planning to write a book on sustainable body transformation combining **data, nutrition, and habit design**.
