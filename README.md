## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, welcome to my GitHub Profile!

I'm **Haoyang 'Henry' Cui**, currently a Master's student at **Dartmouth College**, with a background in **Computer Science and Mathematics** from the **University of Toronto**.

### ðŸ”¬ Research & Work  
I'm actively the following lab at Dartmouth:
- [**Lee Lab**](https://lee-lab.engineering.dartmouth.edu/) â€“ Dedicated to analyzing antibody repertoire evolution (RNA/protein) with **high-throughput methods and modelling** to understand protection and engineer personalized vaccines/immunotherapies.

### ðŸš€ Current Projects
I'm currently working onï¼š
- **Web-Based Immunology Pipeline**  
  Building a web server to bridge **wet lab experiments** and **dry lab data analysis** for **bioengineering of immunology**.
 Goals 
My long-term goal is to leverage machine learningâ€”especially **dimension reduction on RNA/DNA-seq data** and advanced models like **Diffusion** and **Autoregressive models**â€”to build smarter, **personalized digital health systems**.

I'm also currently trying to apply to **PhD programs** to further pursue this path.

### ðŸ’ª Fun Fact
I'm a passionate gym-goer! Iâ€™ve lost over **70 lbs (about 32 kg)** since finishing my undergrad. I'm even planning to write a book about my workout routines and nutrition strategies for sustainable weight control.
